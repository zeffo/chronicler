The current SICSR timetable at time-table.sicsr.ac.in runs an instance of MRBS: Meeting Room Booking System, an open source calendar management software. 
While it serves it's purpose, the online interface is clunky and not mobile-friendly. 
Additionally, users are often required to take multiple steps to view their daily timetable, 
such as applying filters multiple times or finding classes through manual inspection, which is highly inconvenient.

The Chronicler Time & Schedule Management System is a software system designed to resolve these issues 
by providing a beautiful web interface (designed with the "mobile-first" ideology), a Textual User Interface
as well as a REST API to allow users to easily view their timetables and manage their attendance with no hassle, on any device.
